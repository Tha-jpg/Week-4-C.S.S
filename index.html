      <h2>Bio</h2> 
      <p>I’m still finding my way. It feels like I’m an explorer trying to discover new land in the 21st century.
         Every land has already been traversed, every sea charted. Where do I fit in. 
         I don’t even know what I myself want to do yet but I know I don’t have time to sit and ponder.
         Life moves faster than I can worry about it so I do my best to keep doing something never stagnant.
